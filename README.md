## 🌟 The Vision: Tech for Development
In the journey toward **Viksit Bharat**, millions are "digitally included" but "financially passive." Piggy AI bridges this gap by:
* **Eliminating the Jargon Barrier:** Translating complex financial policies into simple, local dialects (Hindi, Telugu, Marathi).
* **Removing the "Middleman Tax":** Automating eligibility checks so rural users don't have to pay intermediaries for basic digital tasks.
* **Democratizing Financial Planning:** Bringing elite wealth management (50/30/20 rules and EMI risk analysis) to the grassroots level.
