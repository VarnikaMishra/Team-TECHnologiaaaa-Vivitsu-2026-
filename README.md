# 🐷 Piggy AI: Agentic Fintech for Social Good

**Piggy AI** is a secure, multi-lingual, agentic financial platform designed to drive social development and financial inclusion in India. Built for the economic landscape of **2026**, it serves as a "Financial Co-Pilot" for Farmers, Students, Small Businesses, and Employees.

## 🌟 The Vision: Tech for Development

* **Removing the "Middleman Tax":** Automating eligibility checks so rural users don't have to pay intermediaries for basic digital tasks.
* **Democratizing Financial Planning:** Bringing elite wealth management (50/30/20 rules and EMI risk analysis) to the grassroots level.
